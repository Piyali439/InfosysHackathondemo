# 🚀 TrustLend – Transparent Microfinance Revolution

**Empowering India’s 190+ million unbanked population through fair, AI-powered credit access**

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional microfinance systems in India are riddled with challenges that lead to financial exclusion for millions:

* ❌ No formal credit history or collateral
* ❌ Inaccurate risk assessment → High default rates
* ❌ Barriers in language, literacy, and tech accessibility
* ❌ Lack of transparency between borrowers and lenders

This perpetuates **poverty, mistrust, and limited financial opportunity**—especially for those most in need.
